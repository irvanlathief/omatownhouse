    body: `<p>Yes, foreigners can invest in Bali property, including buyers from the United States and the United Arab Emirates. What changes is the structure, not the eligibility. Indonesian law does not let a foreign individual hold freehold (Hak Milik) land title, so overseas buyers use one of a few established routes instead.</p><p>The first is leasehold, where you hold the right to use a property for a fixed term, commonly 25 or 40 years, often with an agreed extension. The entry price is lower and the paperwork is simpler, which is why many first-time buyers start here. OMA Townhouse offers 25 and 40 year leasehold on this basis.</p><p>The second is Hak Pakai, a right-to-use title available to a foreigner who holds an Indonesian residence permit such as a KITAS or KITAP. The third is a foreign-owned company, a <a href="https://oss.go.id" data-external="true">PT PMA</a>, which can hold Hak Guna Bangunan, the right to build and use the land. A PT PMA is the route most buyers take when they want freehold-style control and the ability to run the property as a rental business. OMA offers freehold through this structure.</p><p>For a US citizen or a Dubai-based investor, the practical point is that your nationality does not block any of these. You work within the same framework as every other foreign buyer. Money you transfer into Indonesia is reported through the banking system, so keep clean records of the funds you bring in.</p><p>This is general information and not legal or tax advice. Permit categories and rules change, so confirm the current position with a licensed Indonesian notary (PPAT) and the OMA Townhouse team before you commit.</p>`,

In Dubai you can buy freehold as a foreigner in designated freehold zones, a right set out in the emirate's 2002 property reforms, and hold the title in your own name. In Bali you cannot hold freehold as an individual. You use leasehold, a Hak Pakai right-to-use title, or a PT PMA company, the same routes covered in our <a href="/blog/foreigners-buy-property-bali">guide for foreign buyers</a>.</p><p>Entry price is the next split. Dubai's established freehold districts tend to start higher in absolute terms. Emerging Bali areas such as Tabanan sit lower, which is part of the off-plan case. At OMA Townhouse, leasehold starts at 115,000 USD and freehold via PT PMA at 265,000 USD, and land in this area runs well below Canggu prices.</p><p>Both markets draw international rental demand, so the question is less about which is busier and more about where your capital fits. Rental yields move with season, management quality and location, so treat any figure you read as a range rather than a promise.</p><p>Tax also differs. The UAE has no personal income tax, while Indonesia taxes rental income, so a Bali rental needs that built into the numbers. A Dubai buyer used to tax-free rental should plan for it rather than be caught out by it.</p><p>Neither market is universally better. Dubai offers direct freehold and a tax-light setup. Bali offers a lower entry point and a different lifestyle, with ownership handled through leasehold or a company. This is general information, not financial, legal or tax advice, so confirm current rules and pricing with a qualified adviser and the OMA Townhouse team.</p>`,

        question: "Is Bali or Dubai better for property investment?",
        answer:
          "Neither is universally better. Dubai allows direct foreign freehold and has no personal income tax. Bali has a lower entry point but uses leasehold or a PT PMA company and taxes rental income. The right choice depends on your budget and goals.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can foreigners own freehold in Dubai but not Bali?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Dubai lets foreigners own freehold in designated zones. Indonesia reserves freehold for citizens, so foreign buyers in Bali use leasehold, Hak Pakai or a PT PMA company.",

        question: "Are Bali rental yields higher than in Dubai?",
        answer:
          "Yields in both markets vary with location, season and management, so treat any single figure as a range. This is not financial advice.",
